# Voxel Engine

A voxel generation engine built in Pygame and OpenGL. Features terrain generation,
textured blocks, caves systems and more.

This project was written to assist in my understanding of game engines and computer
graphics.

## Building and Running

To build and run the game you will need a Python installation and the `venv` module.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Source

This engine was created following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab8TOSFfNp4)
from Coder Space. Documentation is based on the techniques demonstrated in the video, for
my own record and for others further understanding. This project is licensed the same as
the source created by the original author.
